  # 📈 Day 3 – Regression & Classification Models (30 Days of ML)

Day 3 of my Machine Learning journey focuses on implementing **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** using real-world COVID-19 data in India.

## 🧠 What This Notebook Covers

### 🔹 Linear Regression
- Predicting **Recovered Cases** based on **Total Confirmed Cases**
- Train-test split for evaluation
- Visualization of regression line
- Model evaluation using **Mean Squared Error**

### 🔹 Logistic Regression
- Classifying **High Risk** regions based on **Deaths**
- Thresholding TotalConfirmedCases to create binary labels
- Model evaluation using **Accuracy** and **Classification Report**
- Visualization of predictions

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, LogisticRegression)
